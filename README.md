Star Pattern Drawing with Turtle Graphics

This Python script uses the Turtle Graphics library to draw a star pattern on a black background. The star is filled with a gradient color combination of red and yellow.

 Features:
- **Dynamic Star Drawing**: The script draws a star pattern using Turtle Graphics by repeatedly moving the turtle forward and turning it at an angle.
- **Custom Colors**: The star is outlined in red and filled with yellow.
- **Background**: The drawing area has a black background to contrast with the bright star colors.

 How It Works:
1. **Setup**: The Turtle graphics window is configured with a title ("star pattern") and a black background color.
2. **Drawing**: The turtle moves forward by 200 units and then turns left by 100 degrees. This pattern creates a star-like shape.
3. **Color Fill**: The `begin_fill()` and `end_fill()` methods are used to fill the star shape with yellow color while the outline remains red.
4. **Termination**: The drawing loop terminates when the turtle's position is close to the starting point, completing the star pattern.

 Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Turtle Graphics library (usually included with Python standard library)

 Usage:
Run the script in a Python environment that supports Turtle Graphics (e.g., IDLE). The Turtle Graphics window will open and display the star pattern.

Feel free to modify the colors, angles, and dimensions to create different star patterns!

# Digital Clock Description
This Python script creates a simple digital clock using the tkinter library. The clock displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds and updates every second.

Features:
Real-Time Clock: Continuously updates the display to show the current system time.
Graphical User Interface: Uses tkinter for a straightforward graphical representation of the clock.
Customizable Appearance: Allows easy modification of fonts, colors, and layout to fit different styles.
How It Works:
Setup: The script initializes a tkinter window and sets the title to "Digital Clock".
Time Display: Uses tkinter.Label to create a label widget that displays the time. The format is typically "HH:MM
".
Updating Time: The update_time() function retrieves the current time using the datetime module and updates the label every second using the after() method.
Styling: The clock's appearance (such as font size and color) can be customized directly in the script.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
tkinter library (usually included with Python standard library)
Usage:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Run the script in a Python environment that supports GUI operations.
A window will open displaying the digital clock. It will continuously update to show the current time.
