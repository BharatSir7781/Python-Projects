Star Pattern Drawing with Turtle Graphics

This Python script uses the Turtle Graphics library to draw a star pattern on a black background. The star is filled with a gradient color combination of red and yellow.

 Features:
- **Dynamic Star Drawing**: The script draws a star pattern using Turtle Graphics by repeatedly moving the turtle forward and turning it at an angle.
- **Custom Colors**: The star is outlined in red and filled with yellow.
- **Background**: The drawing area has a black background to contrast with the bright star colors.

 How It Works:
1. **Setup**: The Turtle graphics window is configured with a title ("star pattern") and a black background color.
2. **Drawing**: The turtle moves forward by 200 units and then turns left by 100 degrees. This pattern creates a star-like shape.
3. **Color Fill**: The `begin_fill()` and `end_fill()` methods are used to fill the star shape with yellow color while the outline remains red.
4. **Termination**: The drawing loop terminates when the turtle's position is close to the starting point, completing the star pattern.

 Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Turtle Graphics library (usually included with Python standard library)

 Usage:
Run the script in a Python environment that supports Turtle Graphics (e.g., IDLE). The Turtle Graphics window will open and display the star pattern.

Feel free to modify the colors, angles, and dimensions to create different star patterns!
